This program reads rows from a Source table (having columns FleetId and DriverId) and makes REST API calls by passing FleetId and DriverId as query parameters (one REST call
for each row read from the source table), and inserts the JSON response into a Target table (one row for each REST API response). The JSON response is stored in a [nvarchar] datatype
with length as (max). Below is the DDL for Target table.

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[PRESTG_TELEMATICS_GPS_TRIP_SUMMARY](
[FleetId] [int] NULL,
[DriverId] [int] NULL,
[JSONResponse] [nvarchar](max) NULL,
[META_LastUpdateTimestamp] [datetime] NULL
)
